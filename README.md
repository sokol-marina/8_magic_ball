# Magic Eight Ball
This is a simple Magic Eight Ball project built with React and Vite. The app displays a random answer in the Magic Eight Ball when the user clicks the "Shake" button. Each answer is color-coded, and the app keeps track of how many times each color has appeared. The user can also clear the displayed answer, resetting it back to the number "8."

**Features**
Random answer generation with color-coded messages (green, goldenrod, red).
Display and track the count of each color's appearances.
Clear button to reset the eight ball's display to the default "8."
UI enhancements for a smooth user experience.
